# ABOUT

I have been writing since I could first read. Long before money, metrics, or platforms entered the picture. Writing was never something I did to get paid. Publishing was. 

Those are different acts, and confusing them is how the work starts to feel transactional instead of necessary.

This repository exists because I am stepping away from traditional ebook storefronts like Amazon. I'll still use them upon final drafts, but for now I want to focus more on creating the best possible versions first.

Not because they are uniquely bad, but because they are structured around scale, ads, and constant output. 

Amazon in particular is flooded with low effort content and algorithm amplified noise that makes genuine discovery difficult. 

Most author facing spaces are also built primarily for other writers rather than readers, which turns visibility into performance instead of connection.

# ON ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP

People find ways to get free books regardless of price or platform. When projects like Anna’s Archive disappear, demand does not vanish, it reroutes. Scarcity has never protected writers, and lock in has never built trust.

At the same time, many readers are turning away from ebook stores altogether. Prices have climbed, files are restricted, and ownership is conditional. Paying 9.99 for a book that can only exist inside a single ecosystem feels less like buying a book and more like renting permission.

*I would rather be honest about that reality.*

Most of the work here is free by choice. Files are provided primarily as EPUB, meant to be read, archived, and kept. I retain full copyright over all material in this repository.

Print and audiobooks cost real money to produce and will continue to be sold elsewhere. The narrators of the audiobooks deserve their cut!!

# WHAT THIS IS

*This is not a marketing platform.
This is not a launch strategy.
This is not a hustle.*

**This is a shelf.**

If you found this repository through search, curiosity, or accident, you are welcome here with no obligation attached. Writing has mattered to me since before it was monetized, and it still matters whether or not it sells on a given day.

I am choosing sustainability over grind, readers over dashboards, and permanence over noise.

Thank You!!
