If you are not a programmer, you are not in the wrong place.

This repository contains books in EPUB format. EPUB is a common ebook file type, similar to PDF, but designed specifically for reading on phones, tablets, and e readers. Unlike many store bought ebooks, these files are not locked to a single platform or account.

You can keep them, move them, back them up, and read them where and how you prefer.

## HOW TO DOWNLOAD A BOOK:

- Click on the file ending in .epub

- Click the download button

- Save the file to your device

*That is it. No account required beyond GitHub itself.*

## HOW TO READ EPUB FILES:

### :LiMoonStar: On phones and tablets

Most reading apps support EPUB. If your device does not open it automatically, you can install a free reader app and open the file from there.

### :LiMoonStar: On computers

You can read EPUB files using free desktop reading apps or by importing them into ebook management software. Once imported, the book behaves like any other digital book in your library.

### :LiMoonStar: On e readers

Most modern e readers support EPUB directly or through simple file transfer. You can usually connect your device to your computer and copy the file over like any other document.

## WHY EPUB AND NOT STORE LINKS

These files are provided directly so you actually own what you download. They are not tied to a storefront, an account, or an app that can revoke access later. You do not need permission to keep reading something you already have.

If you prefer audiobooks or print, those formats are sold elsewhere because they require real production costs. Digital text does not.

## IF YOU ARE NEW TO GITHUB

You do not need to understand repositories, forks, or code to be here. Treat this like a shelf, not a toolchain. Read what interests you. Ignore the rest.

You are not expected to star, review, promote, or engage in any particular way.

## FINAL NOTE

If you know how to use EPUB already, feel free to ignore this file. If you did not, that is fine too. This space is meant to be readable first and technical second.

The books are here to be read.
